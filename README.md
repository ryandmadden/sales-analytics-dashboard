- **4 Core KPIs**: Doors Knocked, Homeowners Talked To, Qualified Leads, Appointments Set
- **Conversion Metrics**: Automatically calculates talk rate, qualification rate, and appointment rate
- **Beautiful Visualizations**: Generates 5 professional PNG charts for each lead generator
- **Team Comparisons**: See how you stack up against team averages
- **Date Filtering**: Analyze performance over customizable time periods

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- A Google account with access to Google Sheets API
- Google Forms responses stored in a Google Sheet

## Installation

### 1. Clone or Download This Repository

```bash
cd sales-analytics-dashboard
```

### 2. Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Google Sheets API Setup

### Step 1: Enable Google Sheets API

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project (or select an existing one)
3. Navigate to **APIs & Services** > **Library**
4. Search for "Google Sheets API" and click **Enable**
5. Also search for and enable "Google Drive API"

### Step 2: Create Service Account Credentials

1. Go to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials**
2. Click **Create Credentials** > **Service Account**
3. Fill in the service account details:
   - **Name**: Sales Dashboard Service Account
   - **ID**: (auto-generated)
   - Click **Create and Continue**
4. Skip optional steps and click **Done**
5. Click on the service account you just created
6. Go to the **Keys** tab
7. Click **Add Key** > **Create New Key**
8. Select **JSON** and click **Create**
9. A JSON file will download - **save this as `credentials.json` in your project root directory**

### Step 3: Share Your Google Sheet

1. Open your Google Sheet containing the form responses
2. Click the **Share** button
3. Copy the **service account email** from your `credentials.json` file (it looks like `[service-account-name]@[project-id].iam.gserviceaccount.com`)
4. Paste it in the share dialog and give it **Viewer** access
5. Click **Send**

### Step 4: Get Your Sheet ID

1. Open your Google Sheet
2. Look at the URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/YOUR_SHEET_ID_HERE/edit`
3. Copy the `YOUR_SHEET_ID_HERE` part
4. This is your Sheet ID

## Configuration

### Update config.yaml

Open `config.yaml` and update the following:

```yaml
google_sheets:
  sheet_id: "YOUR_SHEET_ID_HERE"  # Replace with your actual Sheet ID
  worksheet_name: "Sheet1"  # Update if your worksheet has a different name
  credentials_path: "credentials.json"  # Path to your credentials file

data:
  days_to_include: 30  # Number of days to analyze (0 = all data)
  
  # Update these column names to match your Google Form
  columns:
    timestamp: "Timestamp"
    name: "Lead Generator Name"
    doors_knocked: "Doors Knocked"
    homeowners_talked: "Homeowners Talked"
    qualified_leads: "Qualified Leads"
    appointments_set: "Appointments Set"
```

**Important**: Make sure the column names in `config.yaml` match exactly with the column headers in your Google Sheet.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Run the dashboard for a specific lead generator:

```bash
python main.py --name "John Doe"
```

Replace `"John Doe"` with the name as it appears in your Google Form responses.

### Advanced Options

```bash
# Analyze last 7 days only
python main.py --name "John Doe" --days 7

# Analyze all available data
python main.py --name "John Doe" --days 0

# Use a custom config file
python main.py --name "John Doe" --config custom_config.yaml
```

### Command-Line Arguments

- `--name`: **(Required)** Name of the lead generator (must match entries in Google Form)
- `--days`: Number of days to include in analysis (overrides config file)
- `--config`: Path to configuration file (default: `config.yaml`)

## Automated Email Reports

For teams, you can automatically generate and email reports to all team members.

### Setup Email Reports

#### 1. Update Team Roster

Edit `team_roster.yaml` with your team members:

```yaml
team_members:
  - name: "Jessica Martinez"
    email: "jessica.martinez@company.com"
  # ... add more team members
```

#### 2. Configure Email Settings

Update the `email` section in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
email:
  enabled: true  # Set to true to enable email sending
  smtp_server: "smtp.gmail.com"  # Your SMTP server
  smtp_port: 587
  use_tls: true
  username: "your-email@gmail.com"
  password: "your-app-password"  # See below for app password setup
  from_address: "Sales Analytics <noreply@yourcompany.com>"
```

#### 3. Get an App Password (Gmail)

For Gmail users:

1. Go to your Google Account settings
2. Navigate to **Security** > **2-Step Verification** (you must enable this first)
3. Scroll down to **App passwords**
4. Select **Mail** and **Windows Computer** (or Other)
5. Click **Generate**
6. Copy the 16-character password and paste it into `config.yaml`

For other email providers:
- **Outlook/Hotmail**: Use your regular password or create an app password in account settings

```bash
python send_weekly_reports.py
```

This will:
- Fetch data from Google Sheets
- Generate charts for each team member
- Email each person their personalized performance report with:
  - Summary statistics in the email body
  - All 5 charts attached as PNGs
  - Professional HTML formatting

#### 5. Schedule Automatic Delivery

**Windows (Task Scheduler):**

## Output

The dashboard generates 5 PNG charts for each run:

1. **kpi_metrics.png**: Bar chart showing your 4 core KPIs
2. **conversion_funnel.png**: Visual funnel showing progression through each stage
3. **daily_trends.png**: Line chart showing daily performance over time
4. **team_comparison.png**: Bar chart comparing your performance to team totals
5. **conversion_rates.png**: Bar chart showing your conversion rates as percentages

Charts are saved to: `output/charts/[name]_[date]/`

Example: `output/charts/john_doe_2025-10-12/`

## Expected Google Form Structure

Your Google Form should collect the following information:

- **Timestamp**: Automatically collected by Google Forms
- **Lead Generator Name**: Text field for the person's name
- **Doors Knocked**: Number input
- **Homeowners Talked**: Number input
- **Qualified Leads**: Number input  
- **Appointments Set**: Number input

## Troubleshooting

### "Credentials file not found"

- Ensure `credentials.json` is in the project root directory
- Check that the path in `config.yaml` is correct

### "Spreadsheet not found"

- Verify the Sheet ID in `config.yaml` is correct
- Make sure you've shared the sheet with your service account email
- Check that the service account has at least Viewer permissions

### "Worksheet not found"

- Check the worksheet/tab name in `config.yaml`
- It's usually "Form Responses 1" for Google Forms, but verify in your sheet

### "Missing required columns"

- Ensure column names in `config.yaml` exactly match your Google Sheet headers (case-sensitive)
- Check for extra spaces in column names

### "No data found for [name]"

- Verify the name spelling matches exactly as it appears in the form responses
- The script tries partial matching, but exact spelling is best
- Check that there are form submissions for this person

### Import Errors

If you get import errors, ensure all dependencies are installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```

## Customization

### Changing Colors

Edit the `colors` section in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
visualizations:
  colors:
    primary: "#2E86AB"      # Blue
    secondary: "#A23B72"    # Purple
    success: "#06A77D"      # Green
    warning: "#F18F01"      # Orange
    danger: "#C73E1D"       # Red
```

### Changing Chart Size or Resolution

```yaml
visualizations:
  dpi: 300                  # Resolution (higher = better quality, larger file)
  figure_size: [12, 8]      # Width, Height in inches
```

## Security Notes

- **Never commit `credentials.json` to version control** (it's in `.gitignore` by default)
- Keep your service account credentials secure
- Only share the Google Sheet with the service account (not your entire organization)
- The service account only needs Viewer permissions, not Editor

## Support

For issues or questions:

1. Check the Troubleshooting section above
2. Verify your `config.yaml` settings
3. Ensure all Google Sheets API setup steps are complete
4. Check that your Google Form data structure matches expectations
