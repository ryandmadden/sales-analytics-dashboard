# Sales Analytics Dashboard - Portfolio Project

## Project Context
Built in 2023 during my time at a solar panel sales company to solve a critical 
data visibility problem affecting 20 lead generators.

## Business Problem
Sales team was submitting appointments but had little visibility 
into performance. Much harder to track progress, identify growth, 
or coach team members effectively.

## Solution
End-to-end Python analytics pipeline that:
- Ingests data from Google Sheets API
- Calculates 4 core KPIs + conversion metrics
- Generates 5 professional visualizations per person
- Automates email delivery to entire team

## Technical Highlights
- **Data Engineering**: ETL pipeline with pandas, data validation, error handling
- **Analytics**: Metric design, conversion funnel analysis, benchmarking
- **Visualization**: matplotlib/seaborn for static charts
- **Automation**: SMTP email integration, scheduled reporting
- **Architecture**: Modular design, configuration management, comprehensive docs

## Business Impact
- 90% user adoption (roughly 18/20 team members)
- Gave data visibility to Lead Generators
- 30% increase in qualified leads (data-driven optimization)
